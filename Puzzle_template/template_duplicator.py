"""Puzzle template duplicator

This code is meant to be run on my local repository, where it copies
template files from my templete directory to a folder for a specific
days puzzle, and renames everything appropriately,as well as editng
each file to replace the internal references to the puzzle numbers.

It's just to reduce the effort in setting up a puzzle subfolder, it
has no bearing on any solutions otherwise

Assumes that it will be run from the template folder, and that the
daily puzzle folders are one folder up, and then named after the day
number
